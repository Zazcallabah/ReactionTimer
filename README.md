ReactionTimer
=============

Some experimentation with recording and analyzing audio from a mic using XNA.




Details
-------
* Detect RMS of audio recorded from default mic.
* When above an arbitrary pivot for a designated timespan, start timer.
* When timer runs out (random between 1 and 3 seconds), flash window and rest.
* Rest for a few seconds, then restart.


... basically I needed a tool to help me say 'when', which I could trigger using voice.
